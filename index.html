    <h1>Hello, I'm Ashley ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>This is my homepage for Google Ads script updates and releases.</p>

    <h2>Project: SalesScript</h2>
    <p>A lightweight script for monitoring Google Ads performance and sending alerts during a sales period. Built with JavaScript.</p>

  <h2><strong>V1 â€“ Function Build Out & Testing</strong></h2>

  <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
  <p>Last week I worked on setting up my environment and outlining the first script for SalesScript. This version is designed to enable or pause ads, assets, and campaigns based on whether a sale period is active.</p>

  <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
  <p>This week I plan on testing the functions I've written. Since JavaScript is a new language for me, the process has been slower but more rewarding. So far, Iâ€™ve built functions to retrieve the date, define the sale window, and check if a sale label is active. Testing is next.</p>

  <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
  <p>My main challenge is adjusting to the differences between JavaScript and languages I already know like C++ and Python. Itâ€™s a learning curve, but Iâ€™m enjoying it.</p>

  <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
  <p>Last week was focused on organization. Now that the structure is in place, Iâ€™m excited to begin actual implementation and testing of the logic.</p>
