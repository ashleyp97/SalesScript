    <h1>Hello, I'm Ash</h1>
<p>This is my homepage for my Google Ads script updates and releases.</p>
<h2>Project: Google Ads Sales Script</h2>
<p>
  This script is a comprehensive automation script for Google Ads designed to streamline campaign management during promotional sales periods. 
  The script will include a script to enable/disable ads, campaigns, and assets. 
  A sale reporting script that would highlight performance and KPI's as well as recommendations. 
  I'll also aim to include other scripts like budget pacing.

    <h2>Updates & Versions</h2>

    <div class="update">
  <h2><strong>V1 Function Build Out & Testing</strong></h2>

  <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
  <p>Last week I worked on setting up my environment and outlining the first script for SalesScript. This version is designed to enable or pause ads, assets, and campaigns based on whether a sale period is active.</p>

  <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
  <p>This week I plan on testing the functions I've written. Since JavaScript is a new language for me, the process has been slower but more rewarding. So far, I’ve built functions to retrieve the date, define the sale window, and check if a sale label is active. Testing is next.</p>

  <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
  <p>My main challenge is adjusting to the differences between JavaScript and languages I already know like C++ and Python. It’s a learning curve, but I’m enjoying it.</p>

  <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
  <p>Last week was focused on organization. Now that the structure is in place, I’m excited to begin actual implementation and testing of the logic.</p>

  <h2><strong>V2 Testing & Performance Script Building</strong></h2>

  <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
  <p>Last week I added the final functions to my enable/pause Google Ads script. For those who got to look at my proposal, you know I'm working on a large Google Ads script to help advertising agencies during sales periods like Black Friday or Christmas.</p>
  <p>My idea involves a lot of moving parts, specifically about 4–5 smaller scripts working in one larger script. I wrote the pseudocode out for the first script—which handles enabling/pausing—and implemented those functions. Now I'm waiting to hear back from my boss to test this within an account. Since I’m working within a real Google Ads account, testing is tricky. Uploading real ads, campaigns, and assets means I’d need a small testing budget to ensure everything works properly.</p>

  <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
  <p>This week, I plan to start building the next script, which will be more complex. It’s a dynamic sales reporting script that will track important KPIs daily and weekly for client visibility. It’ll break out insights by campaign, ads, and assets—using charts and tables for better organization. The final section will include recommendations or key takeaways for account managers to review during client meetings.</p>
  <p>Everything will be stored in a Google Sheet, so I’ll need to brush up on my Sheets knowledge too!</p>

  <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
  <p>The only impediment is getting the first script fully tested, but I'm working on it.</p>

  <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
  <p>I think my process worked well last week. This week, I want to be more organized. I’ve set exact days and times for working on the project to help keep myself accountable.</p>

    <h2><strong>V3 Testing & Debugging</strong></h2>

<h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
<p>Last week I planned to start working on the next script in the series—a Google Ads sale reporting script focused on campaign-specific metrics, budget pacing, and performance breakdowns. Unfortunately, I had to keep working on the original enable/disable script due to testing issues. I expected to be done with that part, but bugs kept me from progressing.</p>

<h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
<p>This week, I’ve continued testing the original enable/disable script. I ran into two big challenges: first, PMax campaigns are difficult to manage programmatically because of how limited Google’s API access is. Second, the script was accidentally pausing all campaigns and ads instead of just the ones labeled for a sale. That means I need to refine my logic and add more validation before it's safe to use.</p>

<h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
<p>Yes—I'm testing this inside a real Google Ads account, and I can’t risk interrupting actual campaigns. As a workaround, I’m setting up my own personal Google Ads account for testing so I can experiment freely without any client-side consequences.</p>

<h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
<p>My workflow has actually been pretty solid. I’ve been blocking off 3–4 hour sessions, a few times a week, which helps me stay focused and make steady progress. If I can keep that rhythm and finish setting up my testing environment, I think the rest will move faster.</p>

<div class="update">
  <h2><strong>V4 Learning & Limitations</strong></h2>

  <h3>What did you do last week?</h3>
  <p>This week, I built the first Google Ads script for my proposal. I also emailed the professor separately, but I’ve decided that—since these scripts are taking longer than I anticipated to write and test—my focus for this class will be on learning and understanding JavaScript. JavaScript is the foundation of Google Ads scripts, and I’m continuously learning as I build.</p>
  <p>Although I completed my first script based on the original proposal, I ran into a few challenges. The biggest issue is that Performance Max campaigns are so new that Google Ads Scripts don’t currently support them. To work with PMax or Demand Gen campaigns, I’d need to use the Google Ads API, which is too complex to fully dive into during the remaining time in the course.</p>

  <h3>What do you plan to do this week?</h3>
  <p>This week, I plan to add an email notification system to the script and share it with the rest of the team. I’ll also begin building out the second script, which will report on key sales KPIs and campaign performance.</p>

  <h3>Are there any impediments in your way?</h3>
  <p>The biggest impediment right now is that Google Ads Scripts don’t yet support Performance Max, Demand Gen, and certain Shopping campaigns. This limits which campaigns I can automate. However, the scripts I’m building are still useful for other campaign types.</p>

  <h3>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</h3>
  <p>N/A</p>
